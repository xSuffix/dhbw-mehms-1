      <p>Most likely, you have never heard about this number before. It is a worthy competitor though, especially 
      due to its aesthetics as it is not just palindromic (something that is the same back- and forwards) but also contains the artistic complementary of the beautiful windings of the '9' 
      and the strict shape of '7' while being centered by the soft appearance of '3'. Also, each of these numbers has been represented in this 
      ranking, lifting the reputation of such a number.<br>
      Funnily enough, this is not everything. While this number is one of the most beautiful numbers known, it is also palindromic AND a prime 
      number and special in almost any way.
