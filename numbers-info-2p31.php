      <p>The biggest number in this listing, however the most interesting fact about '2.147.483.648' is 
      that this number does literally not exist in this shape. You can not count up to it, even thinking of this number is hard, as it is 
      overflowing our minds. The number just does not fit in our mindsets, generally spoken: this number is mostly conceived in a mistakenly 
      negative manner. More than that, the cursed truth is that everyone knows -2.147.483.648 but its absolute value is a mystery.<br>
      Current scientific view states they are just a bit away from full comprehension of the number.
