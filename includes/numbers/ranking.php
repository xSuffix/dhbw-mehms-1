        There are almost infinite different numbers and we don't even use the majority of these in our lifetimes. However, we still did the effort
        and went through their known entirety. We finally managed to gather a list containing the Top 10 discovered numbers using criteria like usability,
        usage but also rather neglected aspects with examples being aesthetics or the numbers' meanings. This list is not final by any means though,
        as there are still countless people counting days and nights to find new numbers unknown to mankind by now and maybe the one or another may surpass the currently chosen ones
        and receive its representation in an updated and corrected ranking.<br>
        You may be surprised to recognize or know only a few of the following numbers, some of these might be a recurring part of the
        average person's regular life while other numbers could be seen for the first time. <br>
        So get ready for an awesome experience and enjoy the read!

      <p>Before we will finish with our #1 pick, we want to present you a few honorable mentions that were quite close but in the end
        did not make it into the final list. We had the number <span class="blue">79997</span>, a palindromic prime number with a weird shape. However,
        the weirdness of its shape made us prefer '97379' over it. <br>
        The next is a tuple of two very interesting numbers: <span class="blue">12</span> and <span class="blue">13</span>, which are known for their biblical meaning like
        the product of the two important numbers 4 and 3 or the apostles' count and the '13' as the symbol of bad omens, mostly connoted with a friday.<br>
        The last number worth mentioning is the <span class="blue">2</span> as the only even prime number and the represantation of duality, as a concept. <br>
        But let's close this and continue the list with our final pick!
